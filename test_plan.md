#### In-Scope Features

1. **Homepage / Browse Books:**
   * Verify all book elements display correctly (image, title, author, price).
   * Verify the "Buy Now" button is present for each book.
2. **Search Functionality:**
   * Test the main search bar (in the header).
   * Test the secondary search bar ("Search books...").
   * Verify valid search results (e.g., searching "Gatsby" finds "The Great Gatsby").
   * Verify "no results" message for invalid searches.
3. **Shopping Cart & Purchase Flow:**
   * **This is a critical flow.** We need to test:
   * Clicking "Buy Now" adds the item to a cart.
   * Message that added to cart successfully or failed to add to cart
   * Viewing the cart page.
   * Updating item quantity in the cart.
   * Removing items from the cart.
   * The complete checkout process (e.g., entering user details, payment info -  *we need to confirm if this is mock or real* ).
4. **Usability & Compatibility:**
   * Ensure the application is intuitive and easy to navigate.
   * Check for broken links or missing images.
   * **Cross-Browser Testing:** Verify core functionality on **Chrome (latest)** and  **Firefox (latest)** .
   * **Responsive Testing:** Basic checks on simulated mobile view (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to ensure the layout adjusts.

#### Out-of-Scope Features

To be realistic with our timeline, the following will not be tested:

* Performance, load, or stress testing.
* API-level testing (we will test via the UI only).
* Backend database integrity.
* Security/penetration testing (unless a major flaw is found, e.g., SQL injection in search).

#### 4.1 Test Approach

We will use a **manual and dynamic testing** approach focused on **functional** and **usability** testing. We will prioritize test cases based on critical user flows.

#### Project Board & Tools

1. **Project Management Tool:** We will use **Jira** for our project board.
   * **Action (Test Manager):** Set up the Jira board with three columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`.
   * **Action (Test Manager):** Create cards for all tasks listed in Phase 2 and Phase 3.
2. **Defect Logging:** We will use a "Bugs" Issues on Github. Each bug card must include:
   * Title (e.g., "Search bar does not return results for '1984'")
   * Description (What happened vs. What should have happened)
   * Steps to Reproduce
   * Environment (e.g., Chrome on Desktop)
   * Severity (High, Medium, Low)
   * Evidence e.g.Screenshot/Video
3. **Test Case Management:** We will use **Google Sheets** to write and track our test cases.
   * **Action (Test Manager):** Create a Google Sheet with tabs for "Test Cases" and "Risk Register."

#### Risk Analysis Register

**Action (Donie Golanda):** By Nov 4, please populate the "Risk Register" tab in our Google Sheet.


Submit the excel link here plus analysis of the risks, this could be a pie-chart or histogram or bar graph.
--Our risk check includes continuous reviews of the Bookstore app, flagging customer or provider side risks, and creating a corresponding risk matrix:
